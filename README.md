# gw2-raid-discord-bot
Bot to announce info via discord at set intervals

# How to use

## Create a bot user
* Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me while logged into discord and create an app
* Create a bot user for the app
* Authorize your bot to your server (click "Generate OAuth2 URL" and make sure at least send message, connect voice, and speak are enabled, this link should be sent to server admin if that isn't you)
* Go back to the app page, there should be an username and token, with a link called "click to reveal"; copy this down as you will need this later

## Running the bot
* Download or clone a copy of this repo
* Create a file named ".env", and put "DISCORD_TOKEN={token}", where {token} is the token you got from your bot above
* Make sure you have node installed (8+, available from https://nodejs.org)
* Open command prompt to the extracted folder and run the following commands:
	* `npm install`
	* `npm run compile`
	* `npm start`

# Available commands
* `!join` tell the bot to join the voice channel you are currently in; will not work if you are not already in one
* `!start [boss]` Start a timer for specified boss; currently only "dhuum" and "sab" are supported; note that starting a timer stops the previous timer
* `!stop` Stop the current timer

# Docker
If you know about docker I assume you already know how to run this as is, but if you want to run a hosted version of this, an image of this is also pre-built on docker hub under `docker pull stellarashes/gw2-raid-timer`
